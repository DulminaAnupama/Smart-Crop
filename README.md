Smart Crop Recommendation System for Sri Lankan Agriculture

Agriculture in Sri Lanka is highly dependent on environmental conditions such as soil type, rainfall, and temperature. 
Selecting the most suitable crop based on these factors is essential for maximizing yield and ensuring sustainable farming.
This project presents a smart crop recommendation system developed using Python and Flask,
which analyzes key growing conditions to suggest the most appropriate crops along with estimated yields.
The system supports farmers and agricultural planners in making informed, data-driven decisions to improve productivity and reduce cultivation risks.
